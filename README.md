# Curate Apprentice Take-Home Assignment

Hello and welcome to our take-home! A take-home is a small programming challenge that you can complete in your own time, with your own tools. We typically recommend spending two hours on this - don't spend days! We'll then invite you to an interview where we go through it together, with you.

Your starting code can be found in [index.html](index.html). Open it in your browser and make changes in your favourite editor. If you're familiar with other frameworks feel free to use them as you want, but we have provided basic html + Javascript for you to get started from. Feel free to google anything you need to know, we want you to feel like you're working just as you would in Curate. You should also use git to commit your project.

If you're not familiar with git, [here's a guide how to install it](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). You can also just edit the file on Github with your changes once you've finished.

## Ideas for improvements

You can change this any way you want, but we have some tips for starting points for you. Note that you don't need to do all of these, they're just ideas.

- Make the enter key submit the current message
- Write a function that responds to user input
  - For example, write a reply to "Hello"
  - Or greet someone based on their age
- Add some styling
  - Highlight user input separately from chat bot response

## Your space for notes
Update this part of the readme with your notes on what you did - ideally describe briefly what changes you made and what we should pay extra attention to!

- Styling
- New line/Seperate bot reply
- Enter button function
- Cumbersome reply checker, tips?
- Favicon + title
- Arrays
